This is a sample project demonstrating how to use Firebird 4.0 with Zeos on Android 64 Bits.

Getting started:
- Unpack the Firebird files into the firebird folder.
- Grab a firebird.msg from a Windows zip kit - it isn't deployed with Firebird for Android ARM and put it into the firebird folder.

The project was tested with Firebird 4.0. For other versions you might have to do some changes.
